Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component Solution

This is my solution to the QR Code Component challenge on Frontend Mentor. The challenge helped me practice layout, spacing, and responsive design using simple HTML & CSS.


My process

Built with
Semantic HTML5
CSS custom properties
Flexbox
Mobile-first workflow

What I learned

While building this challenge, I improved my understanding of:
Centering elements vertically & horizontally using Flexbox
Using CSS variables for cleaner styling
Applying consistent spacing and typography
Structuring small components neatly
Example snippet I’m proud of:

.card{
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    padding: 18px;
    border-radius: 17px;
    text-align: center;
    margin: 0 1em;
}

Continued development

Moving forward, I want to focus on:
Writing cleaner, more scalable CSS
Strengthening responsive design techniques
Learning utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind
